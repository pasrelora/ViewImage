## What is Maui Meta Tool and How Does it Work?
 
Maui Meta Tool is a small application for Windows computers that allows you to perform multiple tasks on your MediaTek devices, such as:

- Write or repair IMEI: You can flash or repair IMEI on your MediaTek smartphones, feature phones, and tablets. You need to have the database files that come with your device's stock firmware during the flashing or writing process.
- Restore IMEI: You can take a backup of your device's IMEI and restore it anytime. This is useful if you want to switch between different ROMs or firmware without losing your IMEI.
- Repair NVRAM: You can flash or repair the NVRAM of your MediaTek devices. NVRAM is a memory that stores important information about your device, such as WiFi MAC address, Bluetooth address, IMEI number, etc. If your NVRAM is corrupted, you may face network issues or errors on your device.

Maui Meta Tool works by connecting your device to your computer via a USB cable and using the meta mode on your device. Meta mode is a special mode that allows you to communicate with your device's chipset and perform various operations. To enter meta mode, you need to power off your device and press a specific key combination (usually volume up + power) while connecting it to your computer. You will see a yellow screen with some text on your device when it enters meta mode.
